# Eastfield-Tutoring-App
An Android app to help increase awareness about the tutoring services. 

I felt that most students at Eastfield don't know all the free tutoring services are located in the library or they don't know what hours to go so I created this app. 

This app was made with Android Studio and is published on Google Play. It can be downloaded here as well. This was built using fragments and uses a bottom navigation to get to each section of the app. It is based of off the Eastfield Libary Tutoring website http://libguides.eastfieldcollege.edu/tutoring
